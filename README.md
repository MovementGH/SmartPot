# SmartPot

SmartPot is a project designed to alert users when it is time to water their plants. This project contains two modules. The SmartPot web server, and the SmartPot firmware. SmartPot firmware can be installed on an Arduino and ESP8266 and will report the moisture level of a moisture sensor to the SmartPot web server. The web server will allow users to link their pots, set the plant type and name, and receive notifications when it is time to water their plants.
